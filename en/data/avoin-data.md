# Open Data

Data and information are terms that are constantly encountered. Without getting caught up in the deeper semantics, we can state that data contains a collection of measured values, and by analyzing it we get information, and from there we can sift out knowledge. A single piece of data (datum), such as a voice or a computer bit, by itself does not necessarily mean anything without an explanatory context. Creating information from data is not a straightforward process. Different datasets require different methods and the analysis can be done in many ways.

Open data means data that is freely available to all. Typically, open data is shared in an easily machine-readable format, such as csv or xml files.

The Internet is full of useful data, but finding what you are looking for can mean a lot of searching and hassle with file formats. However, by searching "open data", "open data portal", or other similar words you can get started quickly. If students are looking for their own datasets to investigate, it can be good to go through the importance of source criticism at the same time. How reliable is the information from different institutes or states? Is it honestly and neutrally presented, or chosen to support a particular agenda?
