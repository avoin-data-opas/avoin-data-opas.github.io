This folder is to contain English translations of the existing pages.

This happens by creating appropriately named files, to which the _layout and _data/docs files know how to link to. Files have a small header in them,
that is not displayed on the webpage proper. It looks like this:

---
title: Alkuun datan kanssa
lang: fi
ref: data
category: data
---

Changing the parameters there suitably makes things go live.
